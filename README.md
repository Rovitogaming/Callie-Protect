This project stemmed from the fact that our cat "Casper" keeps eating our other cats food (Callie) everytime she steps away from her food bowl
So, this project is based off the concept of bluetooth low energy "Beacons" which are small puck sized devices that advertise themselves using bluetooth. In this case, our cat Callie wears the beacon device.
Using a ESP32 we can detect these beacons and use the signal strength to determine how close they are. So in this case we can detect if Callie is at her food bowl or not.
Our other cat Casper doesn't have one of these beacons on his collar so the servo-operated cover doesn't open for him and only opens if Callie is in close proximity to her bowl!
